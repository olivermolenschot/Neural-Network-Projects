# Neural Network Projects
 Designing different types of neural networks to learn and improve.

The code was written using Python.

I achieved an accuracy of 96.6 % on testing data using this simple ANN. When using a CNN, the accuracy was 99%. Compared to the ANN, the number of errors were reduced by roughly 70%. 

If you would like to test any of the files, you can simply download it. Bear in mind that the file is an ipynb (jupyter notebook format).
